# algorithm-visualizer-project
software to visualize graph coloring algorithm

# Introduction
This project is an implementation of an online algorithm called MINADM[1].
The algorithm colors the network following a few steps.


# Setup
## Dependencies
* NetworkX
* Tkinter
* PIL
```
$ pip install Networkx
$ pip install Tkinter
$ pip install Pillow
```
# Technology
* python 3.10

It is recommended to use Pycharm, you'll have to install the packages, but it is far more convenient.
